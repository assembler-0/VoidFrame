## About

VoidFrame is a 64-bit **ring-0** kernel designed for the x86_64 architecture written in C and assembly (nasm).
This kernel was intended and targeted for people who want to learn about operating systems and want to make a piece of their own.
As the designer of this kernel, I just wanted to make something that is simple, fast, secure and easy to understand.
Which obviously means that it is not a perfect kernel. And it breaks all the time.
But I have tried my hardest to bring many security features to the kernel.
If you were to come across a bug, feel free to open an issue. Fork the repo and make a pull request.
It would be amazing if you could contribute to this project!

## Prerequisites (development)
- x64-compatible cpu (used: Intel i3-12100F)
- POSIX-compliant OS (SysV ABI) (used: Arch Linux 6.16.9-arch1-1)
- cmake >= 3.20 (used: cmake 4.1.2)
- meson >= 1.4 (used: meson 1.9.1)
- ninja >= 1.11 (used: ninja 1.21.1)
- clang/++ >= 18.0.0 (used: 20.1.8)
- rustup (nightly, bare metal toolchain) >= 1.89.0 (used: 1.92.0-nightly)
- nasm >= 2.16 (used: 2.16.03)
- qemu >= 7.0.0 (used: 10.1.0)
- mkfs.fat
- mkfs.ext2
- grub-mkrescue (used: 2:2.12.r359.g19c698d12-1)
    - Note: depending on your distro, grub-mkrescue may require xorriso and mtools packages.
