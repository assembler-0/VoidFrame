## About

VoidFrame is a 64-bit syscall-less **monolithic** kernel (sounds weird and contradicting right?) designed for the x86_64 architecture written in C and assembly (nasm).
This kernel was intended and targeted for people who want to learn about operating systems and want to make a piece of their own.
As the designer of this kernel, I wanted to make something that is simple, fast, secure and easy to understand.
Which obviously means that it is not a perfect kernel. And it breaks all the time.
But I have tried my hardest to bring many security features to the kernel.
If you were to come across a bug, feel free to open an issue. Fork the repo and make a pull request.
It would be amazing if you could contribute to this project!

## Prerequisites

- meson >= 1.0.0
- ninja >= 1.11
- clang >= 18.0.0 (or any C-compliant compiler)
- nasm >= 2.16
- qemu >= 7.0.0 (minimum, failed to run on Limbo emulator (v5.x))
- mkfs.fat (dosfstools)
- mkfs.ext2
- grub-mkrescue
    - Note: depending on your distro, grub-mkrescue may require xorriso and mtools packages.
